## RPM Build Tools for SBT and Native Packager

[SBT Native Packager](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/rpm.html)
is a greate tool to build RPMs from your Scala project, but it
depends on the native rpm build tools which are not that easy
to install on a non-rpm based system.

This docker image provides Java 8, sbt, git and everything
needed pre-installed on CentOS 7 and should make it easy to build
RPMs on any system supporting docker.
